# Operating Systems

## What is an Operating System?
An Operating System (OS) is present in almost every modern electronic device that needs to process information and interact with users.

The OS is stored on persistent storage (SSD or HDD) and is loaded into RAM when the device is powered on.

## Where Operating Systems Are Used
- **Computers and Laptops:** Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Mobile Devices:** Android, iOS
- **Servers:** Specialized Linux distributions and Windows Server versions that keep internet services running
- **Embedded Systems:** Smart TVs, modern cars, and even some household appliances use simplified operating systems

## How an Operating System Works
The OS operates in a continuous three-step cycle:

1. **Listening and Receiving**  
   The OS constantly listens to user actions and hardware signals.  
   For example, when you click an icon, the OS receives that input.

2. **Translation and Resource Allocation**  
   The OS translates the action into tasks and assigns hardware resources:
   - CPU processes the instruction
   - RAM allocates memory
   - GPU renders the application window

3. **Monitoring and Control**  
   While the application runs, the OS monitors resource usage to ensure system stability and prevent one process from affecting others.

## Simple Analogy
The OS works like a government for your computer.  
It does not perform the final task itself, but it creates and enforces the rules and infrastructure that allow applications to run safely and efficiently.

## Why Operating Systems Matter for Cloud
In cloud environments, virtual machines and containers rely directly on the operating system.  
Understanding how the OS manages processes, memory and hardware abstraction is essential for performance, security and troubleshooting.
