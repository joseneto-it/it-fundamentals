# Operating Systems Fundamentals

This section documents my foundational studies in Operating Systems,
focusing on how an OS manages hardware resources and provides a stable,
secure execution environment for applications.

Understanding operating systems is essential for cloud and security
roles, since servers, containers, and cloud workloads ultimately run
on top of an operating system. Misunderstanding OS fundamentals often
leads to performance issues, security misconfigurations, and operational
mistakes.

## Topics Covered

- What an operating system is and its core responsibilities
- Program vs process and process lifecycle
- System boot process and initialization
- Basic resource management concepts (CPU, memory, storage)

## Scope

This content represents **foundational knowledge**, focused on clarity
and correct mental models rather than deep implementation details such
as kernel development or low-level internals.

The goal is to build a solid base for future studies in Linux,
cloud infrastructure, containerization, and security.
