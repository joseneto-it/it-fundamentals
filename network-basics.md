# Networking Basics

## What is an IP Address?
An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to a device connected to a network.  
Without IP addresses, data would not know where to go.

## Main Functions of IP
- **Host Identification:** Identifies the device (computer, phone, printer)
- **Location Addressing:** Indicates where the device is located within the network

## How IP Works
IP addressing can be compared to a city address system.

When data is sent over the internet:
- **Routing:** Routers act like mail carriers, analyzing the destination IP and deciding the best digital path
- **Network Division:** An IP address is divided into two parts:
  - Network portion (neighborhood)
  - Host portion (house)

## Where IP Is Used
IP is present in every data exchange involving a network:

- Web browsing (your device and the website both have IP addresses)
- Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as smart TVs and smart appliances
- Local networks (LAN), even without internet access

## Why Networking Is Critical for Cloud
Cloud infrastructure is networking at scale.  
Concepts like VPCs, subnets, routing tables and security groups are all built on IP networking fundamentals.
